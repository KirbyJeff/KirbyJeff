# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m @KirbyJeff and Welcome to my profile!
- I occasionally work on my repos, but not very often, as I can't seem to find the time.
- I am the official developer of [BunOS](https://github.com/KirbyJeff/BunOS), a Ubuntu-derived OS named for my cat.
- You can contact me through [My Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/KirbyJeef)!
